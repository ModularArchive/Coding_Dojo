For Loop Basic I
Objectives:
Start coding in Python right away
Learn how to use basic for loop statements in Python
Start implementing some basic algorithms in Python
Create a python file called for_loop_basic1.py that performs the following tasks

Basic - Print all the numbers/integers from 0 to 150.
Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.
Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100.  If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print " Dojo".
Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.
Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours (exclude 0).
Flexible Countdown - Based on earlier "Countdown by Fours", given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from lowNum to highNum, using a FOR loop.  For (2,9,3), print 3 6 9 (on successive lines)
A common mistake?
Now, please predict the output for the following codes.

list = [3,5,1,2]
for i in list:
    print(i)
list = [3,5,1,2]
for i in range(list):
    print(i)
list = [3,5,1,2]
for i in range(len(list)):
    print(i)
Please make sure you understand the difference between the three codes above.  Not understanding this may cause some headache down the line.
