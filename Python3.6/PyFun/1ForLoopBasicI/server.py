#1 . Basic - Print all the numbers/integers from 0 to 150.
#for i in range(1,151,1):
#    print (i)


#2 . Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.
#for i in range(5,1000000,5):
#    print (i)


#3 . Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100.  If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print " Dojo".
#for i in range(1,101):
#    if i%5 == 0:
#        i = str(i)
#        (i).replace("0", "Dojo")
#        i = int(i)
#    if i%10 == 0:
#        i = str(i)
#        (i).replace("5", "Coding")
#        i = int(i)
#    print (i)                # I was genuinely upset this didn't work, I could redo but I HAVE to figure out how to use replace

# 4 . Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.
#for i in range(1,500000,2):
#    print (i)

# 5 .Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours (exclude 0).
#for i in range(2019, 0, -4):
#    print (i)


# 6 .Flexible Countdown - Based on earlier "Countdown by Fours", given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from lowNum to highNum, using a FOR loop.  For (2,9,3), print 3 6 9 (on successive lines)

#??? Not sure what the question is





# 7 .Predicted output is printing the contents of the list [3,5,1,2]

#list = [3,5,1,2]
#for i in list:
#    print(i)

# 8 .predicted output is that it wont do anything due to it not being able to be interpreted as an integer

#list = [3,5,1,2]
#for i in range(list):
#    print(i)

# 9 . predicted output is printing 0, 1, 2, 3 because it will measure the string and print the result starting at 0

#list = [3,5,1,2]
#for i in range(len(list)):
#    print(i)
